    "## **Perceptron**\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Perceptron** is a type of artificial neural network unit and one of the simplest forms of a neural network model. It was introduced by Frank Rosenblatt in the 1950s and serves as a basic building block for more complex neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Components of a Perceptron\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Inputs**: The perceptron receives one or more input values, often denoted as $x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Weights**: Each input has a corresponding weight ($w_1, w_2, \\dots, w_n$) which indicates the importance of that input.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Weighted Sum**: The perceptron calculates a weighted sum of the inputs:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   z = w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2 + \\dots + w_n x_n + b\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "   Here, $b$ is the **bias** term, which helps shift the decision boundary.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Activation Function**: The weighted sum $z$ is passed through an activation function to produce the output. In a basic perceptron, this is usually a **step function**, which outputs a binary value (e.g., 0 or 1):\n",
    "   \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathrm{output} =\n",
    "\\begin{cases}\n",
    "1 & \\text{if } z \\geq 0 \\\\\n",
    "0 & \\text{if } z < 0\n",
    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Functionality\n",
    "The perceptron can be seen as a linear classifier that separates data into two classes using a **decision boundary** (a line, plane, or hyperplane depending on the number of dimensions). During the training process, the perceptron adjusts its weights and bias to correctly classify input data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations\n",
    "- The basic perceptron can only solve **linearly separable problems** (e.g., problems where a single line can separate classes).\n",
    "- It cannot handle more complex tasks that require non-linear decision boundaries (like the XOR problem).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Usage and Evolution\n",
    "- A single-layer perceptron is limited to simple classification tasks.\n",
    "- A **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)**, which includes multiple layers of perceptrons with non-linear activation functions, can solve more complex tasks and is the foundation of modern neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "For a simple two-input perceptron model:\n",
    "- **Inputs**: $x_1$ and $x_2$\n",
    "- **Weights**: $w_1$ and $w_2$\n",
    "- **Bias**: $b$\n",
    "- The output is:\n",
    "  \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathrm{output} =\n",
    "\\begin{cases}\n",
    "1 & \\text{if } w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2 + b \\geq 0 \\\\\n",
    "0 & \\text{if } w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2 + b < 0\n",
    "\\end{cases}\n",
